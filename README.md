# Drawing-Animation

## Version:
I implemented this program using the MAC OS 10.15.7 operating system using
Java JDK version 16 with JOGL version 2.4

## Issues:
The code compiles and runs correctly with objects moving according to their purpose in reality.
The sun rotates in the sky, the clouds move across the sky, the tree's leaves rotate to simulate
wind blowing through the leaves. The train moves across the screen along the tracks. There are planes
flying across the sky in the distance and windmills spinning in the distance. There is also a rocket
being shot up into the sky closer to the viewer.

## How to Run:
To run the program, extract the files from the zipped folder and place them inside a package in a Java program.
The JOGL library is needed for the program to run correctly. The code can be run by running the main function in
the DrawWindow class.
